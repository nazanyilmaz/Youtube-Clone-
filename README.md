<h1>YouTube-Clobe</h1>



<p>I would like to introduce you to my YouTube-Clone project that I created with React-Vite.
It consists of 4 different interfaces: Home-Results-Detail-Undefined. I enabled you to navigate between these pages without interruption with react-router-dom.
  The parameters in the sidebar section are active and you will be able to view the latest videos by sending an API request every time they are clicked./p>
